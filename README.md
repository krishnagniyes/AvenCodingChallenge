# AvenCodingChallenge

An iOS Coding challenge:

Using GitHubâ€™s public REST API, display a list of organizations. You can design the list items however you like, but they must include at least the following information:
Image
Name
Description
Github URL

When a user clicks the list item, display a visible affordance showing the item was clicked. When a user clicks the Github URL, the app should open a browser window to that location.
